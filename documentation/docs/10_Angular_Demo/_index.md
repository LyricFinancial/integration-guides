# Lyric Vendor Demo

This site is an angular example of creating a client to interface with the Lyric Vendor APIs.  It uses the [Lyric Snippet](https://github.com/LyricFinancial/lyric-snippet) to interface with the registration api and has 2 routes to show 2 different use cases.




## /lyric-widget
This route mimics the home page of a client's account who has already taken an advance. It adds the widget to the page using ng-bind-html.
