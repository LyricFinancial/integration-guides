/lyric-widget
------------------------

This route mimics the home page of a client's account who has already taken an advance. It adds the widget to the page using ng-bind-html.  Check out the demo [here](http://dev-vatm-demo.lyricfinancial.com/#/lyric-widget?memberToken=:memberToken).  

    You must provide a valid memberToken in the url for the demo to work properly.  

Check out the documentation for the Lyric Widget [here](!Lyric_Snippet/Lyric_Widget).
