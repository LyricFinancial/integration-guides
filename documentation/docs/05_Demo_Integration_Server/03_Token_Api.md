This API demonstrates how the vendor will need to generate a token that will authenticate with the Lyric system.  It can be used when calling loadData on the LyricWidget to view the advanceStatus.  The token needs to be signed with the vendor's private key and include the vendorClientAccountId as the subject and the vendorId as a claim.  Find example code [here](https://github.com/LyricFinancial/demo-integration-server/blob/master/src/main/java/com/lyric/TokenController.java).
